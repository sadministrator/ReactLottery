# Lottery dApp
This dApp was written in react and allows users to enter into a lottery by sending ether to the smart contract hosted on Rinkeby. After entering the lottery users then wait for the contract owner to tell the contract to pick a winner (which it does pseudorandomly) and the contract then disburses the entire lottery to the winning player. The lottery then restarts with an empty pot and no players entered.

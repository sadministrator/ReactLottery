# Lottery dApp
This Ethereum dApp allows users to enter a lottery by sending ether to a smart contract hosted on Rinkeby. After entering the lottery users then wait for the contract owner to tell the contract to pick a random winner and the contract then disburses the entire lottery pot to the winning player. The lottery then restarts with an empty pot and no players entered.
